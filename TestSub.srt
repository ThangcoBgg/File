I really enjoy cooking actually when I

163
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,650
was young I thought I was going to be a

164
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,240
chef

165
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,860
you could be a chef these cookies are

166
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,110
fantastic why didn't you become a chef

167
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,750
my mother talked to me out of it

168
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,040
she thought I would always have to work

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,650
at night she was afraid I would never

170
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,890
meet a man and get married she was

171
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,380
probably right if you were a chef you

172
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,260
wouldn't have met Bob how do you know

173
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,360
before he met you Bob only ate fast food

174
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,180
it's true your mother must have been

175
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,390
very happy when you and Bob got engaged

176
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:19,340
she was hey you'll never guess what bob

177
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,920
was going to be Cheryl a rock musician

178
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,670
that's the ballplayer no bob was going

179
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,480
to be a dancer he was actually in the

180
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,330
state ballet when he was young no

181
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,440
kidding

182
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,290
you never told me this I could have been

183
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,860
a great dancer what made you change your

184
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,880
mind the diet was too hard I had to stop

185
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,790
eating everything chocolate cake fried

186
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,300
chicken potato chips I tried that I

187
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,030
might have been able to do it but then

188
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,170
they said no more bread and butter and

189
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,280
butter can you believe it

190
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,060
and that was the end Wow Bob I never

191
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,720
knew do you enjoy watching ballet at all

192
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,620
I can't I'd like to but as soon as the

193
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:27,030
music starts I get very very hungry what

194
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,820
about you mr. Evans what did you think

195
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,260
you are going to be when you were

196
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,890
younger if I tell you will you try not

197
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,300
to laugh of course I always thought I

198
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,600
would have my own television program to

199
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,560
talk about etiquette I didn't know you

200
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,200
are so interested in etiquette I have

201
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
always loved etiquette I think I would

202
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,550
have made a great television etiquette

203
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,870
teacher well I think you could still do

204
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,380
it it's perfect for you

205
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,720
really why well you're very polite for

206
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,470
one thing you always know which fork to

207
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,660
use at a restaurant that's a real talent

208
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,730
you taught me a lot about the customs of

209
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,589
other cultures maybe I could still give

210
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:31,680
it a try to the conversation if your

211
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,940
internet yes and are leaving the table

212
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,030
early you have probably chosen a topic

213
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,470
that's taboo in their home country

214
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,240
find out what's acceptable what's not

215
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,350
coming up on international etiquette

216
00:12:51,350 --> 00:13:05,060
with Evans what do you think Wow amazing

217
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,740
you have a real talent

218
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:25,540
I don't know I didn't know the planning

219
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,680
a wedding would be so hard

220
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,540
Marie could you give us your opinion on

221
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,380
a few things

222
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,130
I'd love to first how many people should

223
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,460
we invite Bob wants a small wedding 20

224
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,730
guests would be nice I want a large

225
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,890
wedding about 300 people yesterday you

226
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,770
said 200 I have a lot of relatives who

227
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,589
want to come then there's the location I

228
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,839
always thought I'd get married in a park

229
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,680
or at the beach that's so romantic

230
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,960
I would like to get married indoors

231
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,170
where I won't get wet if it's raining

232
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,010
that makes sense

233
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,580
I prefer traditional music in the

234
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,170
ceremony contemporary music I'd like a

235
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,510
long ceremony and a short reception I

236
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,640
want a short ceremony in a huge

237
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,330
celebration afterwards and I want a

238
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,029
chocolate cake I know how we're never

239
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:27,000
gonna agree on this

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,310
don't hurt yourself here's an idea that

241
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,400
might work plan a wedding that's big

242
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,010
enough to include all of Cheryl's family

243
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,000
sorry Bob in the Park on Oak Street that

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,040
has that building where you can go if it

245
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,400
rains you can have traditional music in

246
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,250
the ceremony and contemporary music at

247
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,650
the party and you could have two cakes

248
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,870
at the reception one white and one

249
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,490
chocolate sounds okay to me

250
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,270

world you can go and be completely safe

outside and get hit by a bus but you

340
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,309

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,600
when I read comics that I can understand

369
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,220
why you can't put the book down

370
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,890
I think that I could borrow it then I'm

371
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,299
still reading this one

372
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,840
but I have another one I can loan I

373
00:22:50,840 --> 00:23:07,860
meant this look at this the paper says

374
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,500
that a tornado carried a woman for 300

375
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,159
miles and she lived to tell about I'm

376
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,039
not sure if you know this but that story

377
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,030
isn't true it's in the paper it must be

378
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,820
true that paper is trash

379
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,130
I can't believe you're reading it what

380
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,730
do you mean it's fiction it's not news

381
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,520
nothing in there is true if you want

382
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,380
real news you have to read this paper

383
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,409
that paper is boring this one's much

384
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:42,900
more interesting woman gives birth to

385
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,650
cow man builds house from bread baby

386
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,980
with two heads come on this is offensive

387
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:02,220
storm kills 100 in Texas train accident

388
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,750
kills five injures more man kills wife

389
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,039
and son I'm sorry but all that death and

390
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,700
destruction is pretty offensive to me

391
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,000
I know that these things happened and I

392
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,519
know that those didn't you don't know

393
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,299
that you just assume that it's true

394
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:25,190
let's ask Bob and mr. Evans what paper

395
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:32,179
they read never mind let's just read

396
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,679
that sounds good to me

397
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,429
look at this

398
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:53,090
a man with four legs wacky glasses

399
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,880

00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:27,389
are you kidding

409
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:29,730
if I'd known how happy they would make

410
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,080
him I would have bought those glasses

411
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,580
for Bob long ago technology today is

412
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,539
amazing you know I wish they did invent

413
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,549
something that would make people who

414
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:44,700
talk on cell phones quieter this guy in

415
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,220
the cafe today was so loud I couldn't

416
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:54,149
hear myself talking what oh sorry I was

417
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:59,460
laughing at this guy on TV if I could

418
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,369
invent something it would be a thing for

419
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,350
Bob's car that would automatically

420
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,269
charge him when he goes over the speed

421
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:06,720
limit

422
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,799
he drives so fast sometimes but he'd

423
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,100
slow down if he had to pay No

424
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,789
is your team losing no I heard what you

425
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:22,039
said you just leave my car alone

426
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,940
[Music]

427
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,340
hi Paul wait till you see what I've got

428
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,920
what is it well I have this problem with

429
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,780
my cell phone whenever I'm traveling

430
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,970
with a group I can never hear a ring or

431
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,960
feel it vibrate so I got this thing that

432
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,280
lets me know whenever my phone is

433
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,870
ringing how does it do that it buzzes me

434
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:01,950
buzzes you know yes so I could feel it

435
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,850
does it work I don't know no one's told

436
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:19,190
me yet what oh hello no one's there wow

437
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,490
that was a big buzz it almost hurt maybe

438
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,510
it isn't working right it's working fine

439
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,510
who

440
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,560
strange man if ever get used to that

441
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,480
I'll always know whatever my phone is

442
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,630
ringing

443
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,690
Paul if I were you I would take that

444
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,760
thing back to the store before you hurt

445
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,650
yourself

446
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:05,510
I'm going I'll see you later

447
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,380
hope you drive okay

448
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,220
he'll be fine how do you know I'll stop

449
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,880
calling him

450
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,049
[Music]

451
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,610
did you see the politicians expect to

452
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,159
raise taxes again really what does the

453
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,049
government decide to spend our money on

454
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,020
now they're planning to build a stronger

455
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,679
military it's wrong to spend so much on

456
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,900
the military they should spend it on

457
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,289
education instead

458
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:56,679
can we please avoid discussing politics

459
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,370
why every time we begin talking about

460
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,049
politics people get mad at each other

461
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,390
they should spend more money on fighting

462
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,940
corruption if they were able to stop

463
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,520
corrupt officials maybe they wouldn't

464
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,150
need to raise our taxes that's true but

465
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,010
I think we need to spend more money on

466
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,620
the military without a strong military

467
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,190
the world won't be very safe that's one

468
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,690
way to look at it but maybe the world

469
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,260
would be safer and better if we try to

470
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,929
eliminate poverty what do you think

471
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:40,159
Cheryl I think that if I say what I

472
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,830
really think you'll get all mad and call

473
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,760
me crazy or ridiculous Cheryl don't be

474
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:53,559
so afraid we're only talking I think

475
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,059
that the government should spend more

476
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:02,900
money on cooking schools what most

477
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,730
people don't know how to cook well I

478
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,490
think the government should help teach

479
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,220
them

480
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,660
that's ridiculous are you crazy

481
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:22,090
use our taxes to pay for cookies look at

482
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,530
you you're all mad at me this is why I

483
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,160
never discuss politics with friends but

484
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,350
don't let me stop you from getting mad

485
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,890
at each other

486
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,440
are you traditional in your medical

487
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,660
ideas that is do you kind of believe in

488
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,260
Western medicine or do you like to

489
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,360
explore non-traditional treatments such

490
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,650
as acupuncture or homeopathic medicine

491
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,980
I don't explore non-traditional

492
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,390
treatments as much as I would probably

493
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,880
like to I think there's probably a lot

494
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,400
of merit in them and they haven't been

495
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,950
studied enough I'm more traditional than

496
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,800
anything else in my medication medical

497
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,830
practices I'm more for the naturalistic

498
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,440
approach I like you know more natural

499
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,210
herbal medicines in your opinion what

500
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,830
are the advantages of traditional

501
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,740
Western medicine and surgery

502
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,990
I think the enormous amount of research

503
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,730
and proven fact that that's behind our

504
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,310
medicine just makes it makes me feel

505
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,620
more confident what do you see is maybe

506
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,170
some disadvantages of Western medicine I

507
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,660
think at times Western medicine can make

508
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,460
the problem worse than trying to make

509
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,600
problems better

510
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,540
are there any non-traditional therapies

511
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,770
that you use I drink a lot of tea

512
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,440
actually so I guess that's pretty

513
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,450
non-traditional usually when I feel

514
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,550
myself coming down with something I will

515
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,380
take an echinacea which in herbal

516
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,350
medicine a prior drink a lot of orange

517
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,200
juice as vitamin C helps you but if I

518
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,850
feel really sick then I'll take a cough

519
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,760
medicine could you tell me what your

520
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,880
career or occupation is I'm an

521
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,280
elementary school teacher my career path

522
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,110
will be in marketing helping companies

523
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,400
build their brand and help market

524
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,960
products to it the general consumer I

525
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,610
work in television and I would like to

526
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,620
eventually produce and direct did you

527
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,140
think that you'd be in marketing when

528
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,340
you were a child no I thought I'd be

529
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,890
President of the United States or drive

530
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,380
a fire truck what made teaching a good

531
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,070
career for you first of all I love

532
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,240
children and I liked the idea of

533
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,290
imparting some of my knowledge to young

534
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:56,910
ones

535
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,260
everybody has skills talents and

536
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,720
abilities so you know some people are

537
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,610
artistic others have mechanical ability

538
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,150
what would you say are some of your

539
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,570
skills I'd say I have a little artistic

540
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,890
ability I did a lot of art in school I

541
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,620
could question my skills and talents

542
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,710
would be coming up with new ideas

543
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,680
different ideas creative ideas that kind

544
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,990
of build a buzz around a product do you

545
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,820
think that talents and abilities of

546
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,980
genetic I think they're a combination of

547
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,160
both genetics and environment I think

548
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,050
that you are born with certain

549
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,890
qualities that your parents I think or

550
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,750
having and just living with the people

551
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,750
around you and and and learning from

552
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,160
your teachers and those that you're

553
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,559
constantly interacting with you pick up

554
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,309
certain skills you're from Germany what

555
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:55,460
is a wedding like in Germany well first

556
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,520
of all you have to have a civil ceremony

557
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,790
where you go to to the city hall and

558
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,080
well you make it really you make

559
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,530
everything official and then

560
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,179
traditionally you go to church and have

561
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,668
their religious ceremony and is there a

562
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:16,280
wedding reception afterward usually

563
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,149
there is of course after church when is

564
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:22,250
everybody's waiting for the groom and

565
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,918
the bride coming out and throwing rice

566
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:28,790
at them and flowers and then the whole

567
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,369
crews going to a nice place and having

568
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,699
dinner and having a party you mentioned

569
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,739
that your family is originally from

570
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,199
Ghana could you tell me a little bit

571
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,909
about the courtship and marriage

572
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,800
ceremonies of your country there is a

573
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,310
traditional sometimes they do involve

574
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,020
like the American type of wedding - very

575
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,489
traditional you walk down the aisle and

576
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,159
they also in there is also the

577
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,890
traditional part in African culture

578
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,710
where the clothing the outfits it's much

579
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,069
longer sometimes it can go into the next

580
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,369
day some people it extends tell me about

581
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:11,579
the reception they find a place to go to

582
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:15,269
or it's a outside sometimes it's a big

583
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:17,609
tent like it just depends on the bride

584
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:19,680
and groom and what they want and there's

585
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,900
tons dancing traditional dancing eating

586
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,799
lots of food sometimes you have somebody

587
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:31,440
come in and talk about how they know him

588
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,680
and how how good he is and what he's

589
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,519
done and you know people giving thoughts

590
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,829
of wisdom of how to be together and it

591
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:45,539
just it's just really a great thing how

592
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:47,130
do you feel about prohibiting smoking

593
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,089
indoors as a smoker I don't appreciate

594
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,010
it all the time but I can I can

595
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,400
understand why I think it's fantastic I

596
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,980
think it's great if you don't if you go

597
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,430
to restaurants and nobody can smoke the

598
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,529
food tastes better and your clothes

599
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,440
don't smell how about censorship of

600
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,500
books or movies by a government I am

601
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,589
100% against censorship of any books or

602
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,650
movies or any expression of creativity

603
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,410
and I feel that when government's tried

604
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,440
to censor books or movies then it

605
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,650
creates a sort of atmosphere of fear and

606
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,339
people don't get to don't have already

607
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:33,180
access to information that should be

608
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,009
available to them if you could tell me

609
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:37,769
maybe two things that you think are big

610
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:41,279
problems in the world today I think one

611
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:44,430
of the biggest problems is war and I

612
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,259
think another big problem is racism in

613
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:47,280
this world

614
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,190
and of those could you tell me you know

615
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,900
a little bit more about what you think

616
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,350
could be done to alleviate these

617
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,090
problems I think issue with both

618
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,310
problems it's mostly about understanding

619
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,170
each other and sitting down on a table

620
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,450
and talk and get to know each other and

621
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,370
and be able to make more compromises and

622
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,540
understand different cultures and

623
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,430
reasons why people do certain things

624
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,650
certain ways and I think we would all be

625
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,910
much happier communication communication

626
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,310
that's the that's the clue exactly yeah
